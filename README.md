## Building reliable systems with clear structure and type safety.

I’m a software engineer focused on building maintainable applications
using TypeScript, JavaScript, and Java.

I care more about clarity, structure, and long-term reliability
than quick hacks or short-lived solutions.

---

### What I usually work on

- Designing APIs and application logic with clear boundaries
- Building frontend features that are predictable and easy to extend
- Improving existing codebases instead of rewriting everything

---

### Core Technologies

**TypeScript**
- type-safe frontend and backend logic
- catching problems before runtime

**JavaScript**
- practical UI behavior
- integrations and tooling

**Java**
- structured backend services
- systems built for long-term maintenance

---

### How I approach development

- I prefer explicit types over implicit assumptions
- I value readable code over clever shortcuts
- I optimize only after understanding real bottlenecks

---

### Selected Work

- **Web Applications**
  - frontend logic built with TypeScript
  - clean separation between UI and business logic

- **Backend Systems**
  - Java-based services with clear domain structure
  - APIs designed for long-term use

### Availability

- Open to freelance or contract work
- Prefer async communication and clear requirements
